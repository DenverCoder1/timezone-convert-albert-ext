## Installation

1. Locate the `modules` directory in the Python extension data directory.

The data directories reside in the data directories of the application defined by Qt. Hence on linux the modules would be looked up in the following directories (in this order):

```
~/.local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules
/usr/local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules
/usr/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules
```

Double-clicking on a module in the settings will open the directory in the file manager.

2. Clone this repository into your `modules` directory.

```bash
cd /path/to/modules

git clone https://github.com/DenverCoder1/timezone-convert-albert-ext.git
```

3. Install `dateparser` using pip.

```bash
python3 -m pip install dateparser
```

4. Enable the extension in the settings.

## Usage

Type a time, followed by the word "to" or "in" and then the timezone you want to convert to.

Examples:

`10pm PST to CST`

`8am MST in New York`

## Config

In `config.py` there are options to customize the extension:

### 24-hour time

To enable 24-hour time, set `hr24` to `True`.

### Timezone aliases

To add a city or abbreviation as an alias for a timezone, add it to `aliases` as a key-value pair.
